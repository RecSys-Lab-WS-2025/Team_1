# Frontend Placeholder

This directory is reserved for the future React or Next.js application. Once the framework decision is made, initialize the project here.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Decide between plain React (Vite, CRA) or Next.js.
- Initialize the chosen framework using its official scaffolding tool.
- Configure shared environment variables through `.env.local` or equivalent.
- Add API client pointing to the FastAPI backend (`http://localhost:8000` by default).
